	<h1>Status Posting System</h1>
	</header>

	<div class="about" >
		<h3>Special Features</h3>
		<p>I used buttons for the hyperlinks because I thought it would look nicer. All pages are 
		styled using the same style sheet and have a nice background picture. The database has been 
		populated with a number of statuses with the keyword burger in it. This is a good search 
		word to used to test in the search function. The date feature for posting uses a nice calendar
		to help choose a date and is prepopulated with todays date.</p>
		<h3>Troubles</h3>
		<p>My main troubles was with SQL statements. This was just because I was out of practice
		and I had never used it in PHP before. Sometimes I would have symbols in the wrong places
		or the SQL command just wasn't right. I also had some small problems with parts of the 
		style sheet overriding other parts.</p>
		<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
		<p>I could see putting the buttons in a column on the left side of the page would look nicer.
		Another improvement would be to automatically generate the status code for the user. This way
		they wouldn't have to guess one. Trying to guess an available status code could become very problematic
		as more and more statuses are succesfully loaded into the database. Another thing to improve on would be 
		to improve the readability of the text. Either by changing the background or the text color.</p>

		<p>A big thank you to Glenn Osborn for helping me with my SQL queries. As well as these links:

		<h3>Learnings</h3>
		<p>I learnt that a connection made in a function
		only works within the scope of that function. I aslo learnt that the order you put things in your style
		sheet is important and also that in-line styles can override the style sheet.</p>
